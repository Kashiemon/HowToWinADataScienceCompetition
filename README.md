# HowToWinADataScienceCompetition

This is my final assignment of Coursera Course ["How to Win a Data Science Competition: Learn from Top Kagglers"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/competitive-data-science).

The final assignment is to get high score of the competition of Kaggle ["Predict Future Sales"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales). 

So, this shows my work to get good score in the competition.
